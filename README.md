# MarketStore

I created a database so that the cards could store the necessary data.
I  used System.Data.SqlClient for that. i made models and installed
entity framework. Then I entered user data because without them we 
can't enter card data. Then I entered fake data for cards,before 
saving card, I called a function that lists everything required
in the task in the console. this function is in the GetData class which
has methods for calculating everything required in the task.
I save initial discount rate,not fake data.
